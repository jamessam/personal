              I&#x27;m often interested in rather odd things. So, let&#x27;s
              combine this with baseball and channel my inner

            <h3>Pregame warmup</h3>
            <p>
              Some of the greats in the sport include
              <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babe_Ruth"
                >Babe Ruth</a
              >,

                >Jimmie Foxx</a

                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Mays"
                >Willie Mays</a
              >. What do they have in common, other than being members of the
              Hall of Fame? They all started and ended their Major League
              Baseball careers playing in the same city, but for different
              franchises. Ruth in Boston, Foxx in Philadelphia, and Mays in New
              York.
            </p>
            <p>
              So I got to thinking, what other players of note qualify for this
              distinction? Baseball Reference has
              <a
                target="_blank"
                href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/friv/multifranchise.cgi"
                >a spectacular tool</a
              >
              for nerd questions like this, and I started out looking for cities
              that I knew had multiple franchises in a short time span.
            </p>
            <h3>Swing and a miss</h3>
            <p>
              Seattle was first up, given both the Pilots and Mariners played
              there within an eight year span. Sadly, no one qualifies in this
              city.
              <a

                >Diego Segui</a
              >
              comes close, but he played before his Pilots days for the
              Athletics in both Kansas City and Oakland!
            </p>
            <h3>He gets a hit, and what a hammerin&#x27; hit</h3>
            <p>
              This is embarrassing, but I didn&#x27;t know off the top of my
              head that
              <a

                >Hank Aaron</a
              >
              was the only Milwaukee Brave to end his career a Milwaukee Brewer.
            </p>
            <h3>A double, but out at third</h3>
            <p>Speaking of Kansas City, does that town qualify?</p>
            <p>
              It does!

                >Ken Sanders</a
              >
              and
              <a
                target="_blank"
                href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/w/wickeda01.shtml"
                >Dave Wickersham</a
              >
              both started their careers with the Athletics and ended with the
              Royals. Sadly, though they both played in the early 60s, they were
              not on the same Kansas City Athletics team.
            </p>
            <p>
              This would have been a triple had
              <a

                href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/monteau01.shtml"
                >Aurelio Monteagudo</a
              >
              not played a final season with the California Angels.
            </p>
            <h3>Washington goes yard</h3>
            <p>
              So it turns out this phenomenon is amazingly frequent. Washington,
              DC, definitely qualifies with
              <a
                target="_blank"
                href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/schaijo01.shtml"
                >Johnny Schaive</a
              >
              having played for both Washington Senators--and only the
              Washington Senators--over his five year career.
            </p>
            <p>But here&#x27;s a question for you!</p>
            <p>
              <i
                >Was there a player that only played for two years, for two
                franchises, both named the Washington Senators?</i
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              Yes, there is, and his name is
              <a
                target="_blank"
                href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/h/hernaru01.shtml"
                >Rudy Hernandez</a
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              But what if I told you there&#x27;s someone else, who goes even
              weirder in only playing in two games. That can&#x27;t possibly
              exist, can it?
            </p>
            <p>
              He can. His name is
              <a
                target="_blank"
                href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/maesthe01.shtml"
                >Hector Maestri</a
              >, who played in one game for the team that would be the Twins,
              and one that would be the Rangers... and he even managed to only
              pitch two innings for the original Senators.
