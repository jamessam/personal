              Desolate. Stepping inside to the air conditioned discount store,
              our protagonist immediately feels the foreboding of a dying mall.
              Not that there weren&#39;t clues outside. The closed streets, the
              detour cones, and the light traffic were all there. But it&#39;s a
              Tuesday afternoon after a holiday weekend, and those signs say
              “pardon our dust.” It&#39;s just a transition period, right?
            </p>
            <p>
              The wide open space gives way to an oblivious, sauntering store
              clerk. Like a 1980s game of Frogger, our hero lightly adjusts his
              gait to avoid knocking into the clerk. Or is it a security guard?
              Regardless, it&#39;s quickly out of mind.
            </p>
            <p>
              It&#39;s a weekday afternoon in the discount store. The odd
              gentleman or two are perusing the racks in the men&#39;s section.
              A woman is walking swiftly back to the parking lot, past the roped
              off sections and out of the fluorescent lighting that&#39;s
              strangely dim. Aren&#39;t fluorescents supposed to feel clinical?
              I suppose the conversation she&#39;s having in Spanish on her
              phone warms the place up.
            </p>
            <p>
              Good luck finding a clerk for assistance should you need it, but
              our man does not. He finds the housewares section he came to
              peruse. The mall is only a side quest on his journey to
              discovering the best places for Chinese in this Bay Area, but the
              hike to the University area needed to have more to it than
              foodie-ism. Skimming the bedding options, he&#39;s not surprised
              linen quilts are nowhere to be found. It&#39;s a discount
              department store. Maybe other places in the mall will have one.
              After all, a furniture store is another anchor store.

            <p>
              Hello, darkness. An expectation of vibrant consumerism is quickly
              dashed. Walking through the corridors of the mall, shop after shop
              is closed, lights off, and–half the time–boarded-up. A childless,
              young couple is window shopping at the by-appointment toy store.
              Natural light from above provides a welcome respite, but with the
              phalanx of darkness on both sides, the bleakness engulfs all.
            </p>
            <p>
              The way to the furniture anchor includes a jaunt through the food
              court. The escalators up are in fine order, but they reveal an
              empty atrium below. Our protagonist can only imagine what the
              Santa stand must have looked like at Christmas, decades past. The
              columns seem to be perfect for candy cane and tinsel decorations.
            </p>
            <img src="../images/mall2.jpg" alt="A barrer atrium" />
            <p>
              Half-closed, it&#39;s a wonder the food court has multiple open
              stalls. And is it intentional that they&#39;re all on the same
              side? Every stall is custom designed; it can&#39;t be easy to move
              stalls. The gentleman at the teriyaki stand eagerly extends a
              sample on a toothpick for this lone man cutting through the court.
              “No thanks, I just ate,” our hero says in his own mind to the
              chicken vendor on his periphery.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another corridor of closed stores and then BAM. He&#39;s at the
              furniture store, except he&#39;s not. Microsoft Word printed signs
              in English and Spanish haphazardly placed on the window tell
              potential customers the store hours. They also tell them which
              entrances are open. The entrance to the furniture store from the
              mall is closed. Is it to prevent theft? Looking into the store, it
              seems like that portion of the store is more warehouse than
              showroom. Or does it indicate something even worse? The lack of
              traffic really must be dire.
            </p>

              A 180 and the trek repeated in reverse, our protagonist is now the
              one abandoning the fluorescent lighting of the discount store.
              Unlocking and starting his car, he exhales. This walk knocked
              something out of him, and this is quite the punctuation. The last
              song he was listening to resumes on the car stereo: Muse&#39;s
              <em>Dead Inside</em>. Indeed.
